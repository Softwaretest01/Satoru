                    <h2>Season 1</h2>
                    <p>Satoru Gojo is a powerful and enigmatic character in the series. He is a Jujutsu Sorcerer, a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High, and is considered one of the strongest characters in the series. Gojo possesses immense cursed energy and is known for his distinctive appearance, with a blindfold covering his eyes. He's a charismatic and somewhat eccentric character who plays a significant role in guiding and mentoring the main characters, Yuji Itadori and Megumi Fushiguro, as they navigate the world of curses and jujutsu.</p>

                    <p>In "Jujutsu Kaisen 0," you'll learn more about Yuta Okkotsu, who is the main protagonist of the prequel, and his experiences with curses and jujutsu sorcery. The prequel delves into Yuta's journey, his interactions with other characters, and the development of the Jujutsu Sorcerer world before the events of the main series. While Satoru Gojo may not be a central figure in this prequel, the lore and world-building aspects of the Jujutsu Kaisen universe are still explored.

                    <p>In the second season of Jujutsu Kaisen, Satoru Gojo, a beloved and powerful character, is not the most important figure in the story. The Shibuya Incident arc reveals the consequences of Gojo's absence and showcases the growth of other characters like Yuji Itadori and Megumi Fushiguro. Gojo's real mission is to train and inspire a new generation of Jujutsu Sorcerers, making his role as a mentor far more significant than his individual character.</p>

                    <p>In the Shibuya Incident arc of Jujutsu Kaisen, Satoru Gojo is a major figure.
